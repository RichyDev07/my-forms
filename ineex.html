    <h1>How to make a web page with <a href="https://txti.es/"> txti</a></h1>
    <p>The only thing you have to give txti is the "Content." Txti takes care of the rest, 
        but you <br> can take advantage of these options:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Custom URL</dt>
        <dd>This is the part that goes after "txti.es/" like "txti.es/barry". Currently only 
            accepts <br> lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), 
            and dashes (-). If you put anything else in <br> there, txti will change it.
        </dd>
        <dt>Custom Edit Code</dt>
        <dd>Txti will give you a random edit code, but you can change it. You have to have this
             to <br> make changes to the
             txti, and it can never EVER be retrieved if lost.
        </dd>
        <dt>Title</dt>
        <dd>
            Give your txti a relevant title so it shows up better when shared on social
             media <br>, search results, and in browser windows.
        </dd>
        <dt>Author</dt>
        <dd>
            Let people know who made this! This shows up in some searches and social media <br> posts, 
            and your Twitter handle works really nicely if you post the link on Twitter
        </dd>
        <dt>Description</dt>
        <dd>This is a short (200 character) summary of the page. This shows up in
             Twitter cards <br> and search results. Txti will automatically use the first 200 characters
             of your txti as a <br> description if you don't provide one
        </dd>

    </dl>
    <h3>Make your txti easy to read and understand</h3>
    <p>You can make your txti robust and full-featured with links,
         images, lists, headings,
         and <br> more. Txti uses a popular set of rules called
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown.</a>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>#Heading 1 = biggest heading</li>
                 ##Heading 2 = second biggest heading <br>
                 ###Heading 3 = third biggest, and so on
            <li>Two spaces (space bars) at the end of a line starts a new line.</li>
            <li>Return twice (leaving an empty line) starts a new paragraph</li>
            <li>*italics* = italics</li>
            <li>**bold** =<a> bold</a></li>
            <li>Links: [link to txti](http://txti.es) =<a href="http://txti.es/">link to txti</a> 
                (note: be sure to include the "http://" part <br> of the link)</li>
            <li>Images*: ![Monkey selfie](http://i.imgur.com/FXSBf8c.jpg)</li>
            <li>Bulleted lists</li>
                <a>- Bulleted item a</a><br>
                <a>- Bulleted item b</a><br>
                <a>- Bulleted item c</a>
            <li>Numbered lists:</li>
            <li>1.Numbered item 1</li>
            <li>2. Numbered item 2</li>
            <li>3. Numbered item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*Images must be uploaded somewhere else (we recommend <a href="http://imgur.com/">imgur.com)</a>
            Because <br> images can really slow down pages and we're all about "fast web pages for everybody,"<br>
             images are not displayed by default. The reader has the option of displaying the 
            images in <br> the page or just viewing links to them. See an example at 
            <a href="https://txti.es/images"> txti.es/images</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Important notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Txti will delete any pages that are more than 6 months old but have been viewed <br>
                less than two times ever. If you 
                make a txti and forget about it, it might not be there 6 <br> months later.
            </li>
            <li>Legal concerns or pages you think violate txti's
                 <a href="https://txti.es/terms">terms of service </a>
                 can be sent via <br> private message or tweet to 
                 <a href="https://twitter.com/@txties">@txties on Twitter.</a>
        </ul>
        <a href="https://txti.es/" class="txt">txti home</a>
